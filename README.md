# Library-Management-System
# Introduction
Basically, this is a desktop based app which contains six items. It is a secret password which is only known by user. First item is adding books .This means that user can add unlimited number of books which are store in library. Second item is delete which is that if any books lost in library or remove in library user can delete form this. Third item is issue .Any student can issue any books by using his name and id if the book is available in library. Again user can see all issued books and all books. Besides after reading books when student return that books, he can non-issue thus books.

# Conclusion
This project is now many restricted. It is now use for only one department And it is very useful. In future I will develop it for any library management. In future, by using this app any library can be managed. This application can be easily implemented under various situations. We can add new features as and when we require. Reusability impossible as and when require in this application. Reusability is possible as and when require in this application. We can update it next version. Reusable software reduces design, coding and testing cost by amortizing effort over several designs. Reducing the amount of code also simplifies understanding, which increases the likelihood that the code is correct. We follow up both types of reusability.
